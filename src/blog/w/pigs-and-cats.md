# Pigs and cats

At night, a hotel is located on the edge of a cliff near the sea, only one room light is on. The room was bright and stately, and there were several pigs sitting on dining chairs, they were well-dressed and courteous, and were elegantly enjoying the delicious food on the table. At that moment, a skinny black cat ran under a pig and screamed miserably. The pig looked at it and threw the leftovers from the plate to the black cat, who immediately hid the leftovers and began to enjoy them alone.

The dishes on the table were getting smaller and smaller. A cook pushed a machine and it took down the vases and murals in the room and threw them into the machine, which smoked black smoke, and the delicious dishes came out from the conveyor belt on the other side of the machine. The cook brought these dishes to the table, and the pigs at the table just kept on eating. More and more skinny cats appeared from the corner, and they all screamed miserably under the pigs. One pig dropped a few pills on the floor, and the cats fought for them even though they hurt each other.

When the precious items in the room were consumed by the machine, the cook made fewer and fewer dishes. The pigs at the table couldn't sit still, they didn't look so graceful, even the table manners were forgotten. The cats were so hungry that they circled around the table, but none of the pigs paid attention. The cats screamed miserably, and one of the pigs took out a toy mouse, wound it up and put it on the floor. The toy mouse ran on the floor, attracting the attention of many cats, and the pigs continued to eat non-stop.

The items in the room were almost consumed by the machine, the cook could barely make many dishes, the pigs at the table completely pressed on, they began to impatiently fight for dishes at the table. Some of the pigs directly to their own plate, they began to fight over the plate, the plate there is a pill fell to the ground, the pill through the tablecloth rolled to the bottom of the table, a cat followed the pill, through the tablecloth, into the bottom of the table, when he saw the pigs legs are intricately entwined with the chain, the chain lock into the shape of a python, devoured the cat.

The walls of the room were stripped down by the cook and stuffed into the machine to make dishes, but all that came out of the machine conveyor belt were empty plates. The pigs at the table were banging the table with cutlery to signal the cook to hurry up and serve the dishes, but the cook shook his head helplessly. The pigs were anxious, they started to fight for the empty plates on the table, and then licked the empty plates regardless, and even chewed the empty plates and ate them, the cats were also very anxious, they stirred the tablecloth, and even jumped on the table, and the pigs fought for the plates.

The pigs were so angry that they grabbed the cats and slammed them to the ground, while the cats resisted, they jumped onto the table collectively and finally turned into a tiger, howling in anger. The tiger first pounced on a pig wearing a vestment, tearing and biting, blood splashed to any corner of the room, the floor was a bloody mess, the other pigs suffered the same fate. After that, the tiger was sleepy and fell asleep on the dining room table in a pool of blood.

The cook, holding his head in fear, hid behind the machine. When he found the tiger asleep, he picked up a sharp dagger and quietly walked up to the tiger and stabbed it in the neck, killing it. The cook cut open the tiger's belly, from which he took out a few kittens, leaving this empty and dilapidated room, into a new room. The room was still so bright and stately, the cook put down the kittens, the kittens went to the dining table, transformed into several pigs, sitting on the table, the table were delicious food, the cook took out a box, the box of tableware distributed to them.

The pigs were sitting on dining chairs, they were well-dressed and courteous, and were elegantly enjoying the delicious food on the table…
