- **表语**：名词 or 形容词

##### 主语 + 谓语（+ 状语）

 不及物动词（Intransitive Verb）vi.

- **特点**：主语自身可以完成，不需要作用对象
- **习惯**：带状语（修饰动作的成分）

##### 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语

 及物动词 (Transitive Verb) vt.

- **作用**：说明主语动作的作用对象
- **宾语**：主语动作承受对象

##### 主语 + 谓语 + 间宾 + 直宾

 双宾动词 (Dative Verb)

- **特点**：后面成分有**人**（间接宾语<接受者>）又有**物**（直接宾语<承受者>）

##### 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语 + 宾语补足语

#### 区分双宾语和复合宾语

 在间接宾语后加上 be 动词，若能成句，则是补足语。
